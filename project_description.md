# Project Description: Project Sentinel

## 1. Vision

Project Sentinel is a state-of-the-art, AI-driven **Human Risk Management Platform**. It moves beyond traditional phishing tests to provide a fully integrated, adaptive training system that builds a resilient security culture. The platform will be designed for a **non-technical administrator**, featuring a slick, futuristic, and self-explanatory single-page application that makes managing human security risk effortless.

## 2. Core Problem & Solution

Companies struggle with generic security training that fails to change user behavior. Sentinel solves this by using AI to create **hyper-personalized, multi-channel simulations** (Email, SMS, Slack/Teams) that mimic real-world threats. It provides just-in-time micro-learning and uses predictive analytics to identify high-risk users *before* they are compromised, transforming security from a compliance chore into a proactive defense strategy.

## 3. Key Differentiators

* **Autonomous & AI-Powered:** The platform's AI autonomously manages campaigns and personalizes content, saving the administrator time.
* **Predictive Analytics:** Provides a dynamic "Human Risk Score" for every employee.
* **Futuristic & Simple UI:** A minimal, icon-driven, single-page application with a guided setup wizard makes it accessible to novices.
* **Turnkey Setup:** A one-command setup script using Docker makes deployment trivial.
